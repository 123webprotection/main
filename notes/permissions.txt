prod and dev has seperate contexts...
	 2 Total, so our policy will be avail to all.

very simple config per plugin.
	json of {type: 0/false/[],{childs},"" desc:"", secret: Y\N (hide text)}
		isValid callback
		onChange
			generateSchema based on value
			save to file?

config of plugin:
	- type 
		- <Desc,Bool>
		- <Desc,String>
		- List<?>

*** files (make script):
	- readme MD \ html \ images -> sandboxed iframe
	- js files
	- static files
	- xml? with version for update {0.0.0}

*** each can console.log, and make EP for images (canvas support?)


** you define permission file and take data from there, so Typescript will help you
** 

=======================

actions.allow_stop Y\N
actions.bypass ---> Make url trusted

req.before.url.domain.read , <domain> <path> params[Y\N]
req.before.url.domain.modify , <domain> <path> params[Y\N]
req.after
res.headers
res.after

req.(no * support).url.header.read, <URL Matcher>, Header Name

		Group by domain mach, actions with header will still need to use extra header info
		
		Shutdown\Lock actions cannot be grouped
			Will happen by agent but not on admin account

=======================

Privacy - Risk Levels: (not for stopping crypto or ads)
	* no out,
	No full acess:
		* out, exact in+out
		* out not exact  
			* exact domain
			* not exact domain
	Full Acess
		* any out + full read access req\res || auth headers
		
- notify on updates if policy not the same.

Set url\html\Run JS in page - Seperate Alert because might show ads.

=======================

how to share stuff like "Time blocked" with other plugins?
	- Data only plugins (Plugin with types "Policy Plugins")? (with fetch\save)
		How to do mapping mode then?
			One time high alerted plugin with save rights?
	- ENV or postMessage might be used to send data and escape Permissions

=========================
permission:
	- Block level
		- Test and Prod:
			- Suggest Block
				- Suggest Risk 1-100
			- Block
			[V] Nothing (Allow unless blocked)
		- Prod only:
			- Allow and stop checking
			- Allow After Block
	- Inptuts:
		Contexts
			Proxy.Net
				allow Trusted SSL = allow domain bypass
			
				onReq
					*Access Per:
						- All web
						- domain \ path
							- contain
							- regex
					[] URL
						[] Allow read of X 
							domain
							path
						[] Allow set of 
							path
							domain
					[] Headers
						[] Allow read of X (like header)
						[] Allow set of X (header)
						[] Auth 
							[] Cookies - Default false
							[] WWW-...
							[] Auth
					[] Body
						[] sendFilter
							[ ] blocklist values:
								- pass/password/username/un
							sendRegex
							sendWord
						[] Stream - pass body for:
							* json
							* html
				onResp
					(on top of the request)
					html
						querySelector - whitelist
					json
						path - whitelist with [*]
					sendRegex
					sendWord
					[ ] Full read access
			Chrome.Ext
			Helper.Wifi
				read hashed names
				read real names
			Helper.Time \ Shutdown?
		request REST API Webhook
			* Response is action enum only? (ALLOW,BLOCK,TRUSTED) ?
			** Think about it, how can we share 123Policy result without reason? and reason might leak data
		fetch - download data only 
			- constant path\data
			- constant domain but no path
				- constant\ dynamic data
	- Outputs:
		- sandboxed files
		- shared files?
			- constant paths
		- REST API Webhook Response to requester
		- fetch
			- domains
			- paths
		- outputfiles
			- Format or Absolute
			
	- Allow acces by other plugins - like postMessage
		allow readData from List<X>
			implies sendData for other
		allow sendData to List<X>\All === Just like any output
			implies readData for them
